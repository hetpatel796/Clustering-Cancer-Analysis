# Clustering-Cancer-Analysis
ML Project: Clustering for Cancer Analysis This project uses clustering techniques like K-Means to analyze cancer data, uncovering patterns through EDA and unsupervised learning. Tools include Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Features preprocessing, visualizations, and evaluation metrics for actionable insights.

**1. Importing Libraries**

Essential Python libraries are imported, such as:
**pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

**numpy**: For numerical operations.

Visualization libraries like **matplotlib or seaborn**.

These imports suggest a focus on data exploration and visualization.


**2. Data Loading**

Code to load datasets using pandas (e.g., .csv files).
The dataset's structure is inspected using commands like .head(), .info(), and .describe().
Provides an overview of column names, data types, and initial records.


**3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

Handling of missing values using methods like:
Imputation (mean/median/mode).
Dropping unnecessary rows or columns.
Encoding categorical data into numerical forms.
Scaling or normalization techniques if numerical variables are present.


**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Visualizations like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, or heatmaps to understand data distribution and relationships.
Summary statistics and insights from the dataset, such as correlations or feature importance.


**5. Model Development**

May include machine learning workflows:
Data splitting into training and testing sets.
Fitting models like regression, classification, or clustering using sklearn or similar libraries.
Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE (if applicable).


**6. Results and Insights**

Final outputs from models or analysis:
Visualizations of predictions or clusters.
Summary of findings and their implications.
Documented insights for real-world applicability.


**7. Conclusions and Recommendations**

Markdown cells summarizing the project's success, challenges, and future work.


**8. Supporting Visuals and Code**

Plots and tables generated throughout the notebook, making it visually rich.
Code snippets accompany each analysis step for reproducibility.
